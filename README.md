# DL-Object_Detection
The goal of this object detection is to detect a hard-hat/construction helmet

In many factory environments, when employees enter a designated area, they must be wearing proper Equoments such as a construction helmet. 

This project shows a solution which can be used to issue an alert  when an employee has been detected and is not wearing a helmet in a designated area

The code needed to recreate the training data 
and train the model is detailed in the https://github.com/amancrackpot/DL-Object_Detection/ in the object_detection.ipynb notebook.
